`raquamaps` is an R package providing a number of functions that make it easier to produce Aqua Maps - model-based large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. This package can be used in an IDE like RStudio or from an application like QGIS or the embedded UI can be used directly from a web browser in order to generate predicted distribution maps for marine species.

It's already possible to generate Aqua Maps with existing tools from http://aquamaps.org, but the raquamaps R package offers an open source alternative to the earlier MS Access based solution, which simplifies sharing and collaboration, clarifies licensing and creates a solution which is easier to maintain and develop further.

## How does it work?

The model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, and association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences, called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available from online collection databases.

## Installing from github

If you want to install the latest version of the raquamaps package from github, you can do it like so:

```console
 # if you do not yet have it, install it with
 
install.packages("devtools") 

# install the raquamaps package from github with this command
# which may require RCurl, if so you can first install RCurl with ...
# install.packages("RCurl")

install_github("raquamaps/raquamaps")  

# ... or you could install without the RCurl requirement with this:

install_git("https://github.com/raquamaps/raquamaps.git")
```

## Building

Open the raquamaps directory's .Rproj file in RStudio and use the Build tab to build a source tarball (it will use the version number in the DESCRIPTION file). 

You may need to install a few libraries for the build to go through. R libraries can be installed from within RStudio. Or you could do it at the R prompt with.

```console
install.packages("RCurl")  
```

On some linux distros you may need system libraries, can be installed like so:

```console
sudo apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Don't forget to put the .tar.gz source tarball into the archive-tarball directory before pushing changes to gitorious/github.


## Quick Start

To see some quick examples to get you started, install the `raquamaps` package and then open the `dev_alg.r` file.

### Credits

TODO: Rewrite this!

raquamaps would have not been possible without many amazing R libraries, such as

* dplyr, stringr etc from Hadley Wickham
* rgbif, rfishbase etc from ROpenSci
* rMaps
