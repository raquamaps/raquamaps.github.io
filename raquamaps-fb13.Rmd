Database developer working at the Swedish Museum for Natural History in the biodiversity informatics section of the research department. 

The work on the `raquamaps` R package has been supported by the EUBON project. Joint work with OnÃ©sime Prud'homme, Kathleen Reyes, Cristina Garilao and others.

## What are Aqua Maps

Aqua Maps -- see http://aquamaps.org -- are model-based large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. 

Origin: `Kaschner, K., J. Rius-Barile, K. Kesner-Reyes, C. Garilao, S.O. Kullander, T. Rees, and R. Froese. 2013. AquaMaps: Predicted range maps for aquatic species. World wide web electronic publication, www.aquamaps.org, Version 08/2013.`

"Environmental envelopes" - The default prediction model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, and association with sea ice or coastal areas.

## Why use R for Aqua Maps?

For the "Open Science" approach. A vibrant community of millions of data scientists use R often through RStudio as their favorite platform for end-to-end reproducable research work.

## Current Status

- Bundles a range of various reference data sets in the package
- Developed on Linux - now being tested on Windows and Mac
- Can do batch calculations
- Workflows for marine versus freshwater realms

Long form documentation providing a tutorial that outlines common usage and workflows - a so called Vignette - is available in the package and also online:
    - https://raquamaps.github.io/raquamaps-intro.html

## Future directions

- Adding shiny web UI with visualizations
- Adding quarter-degree cell resolutions - support for finer grids
- Adding support to get environmental layers from suitable online sources
- Bug fixing / Quality Assurance - comparison with aquamaps.org results
- Vagrant project "gisbox-server" - showing integration with qgis server etc

Getting ready for `ropensci`? See amazing tools for reproducible research at https://ropensci.org/

## Getting the software and using it

- Getting started instructions at https://raquamaps.github.io/
- Open source license, free use, get the code at https://github.com/raquamaps
- Use on Linux, Windows or Macs from apps like RStudio, Quantum GIS
- Open access to code and your contributions and collaboration is welcome!

## Developer contributions to `raquamaps`

- R package created to support workflows in Aqua Maps scenarios, attempts to follow guidelines from professor Hadley Wickham regarding R package development
